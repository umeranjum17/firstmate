# fm-dashboard.sh - build and serve the read-only fleet dashboard for this home.
#
# The dashboard is the app in bin/fm-dashboard/ (vendored Preact, htm and Inter; no network
# reference; light and dark): Board, a kanban of Building, Review, Test, PR + CI and To merge
# with tabs for Queued, Landed today and All and rows by home on request, whose cards carry
# the lane's model, age, pull request and, when it waits, why in plain words; filters by
# home, model and state; a card's detail with its stages and activity; Needs you (the ask
# list); a mount point for the ship view (ship/index.js); a command palette and keys (?).
# On a phone the board is a list grouped by stage, with a dock.
# Each build writes the app's one data file, state/dashboard/board.json: homes with their
# lane plans, one card per open lane, ready backlog item and pull request landed today
# (stage from its status lines, wait, model from the fleet ledger's dispatch, and those lines
# with each one's verb and the stage it had reached, which the app words plainly), the
# ask list (the only source of "needs you": a lane's own decision is its home's, Main's or
# its lead's), landed per day, cycle times (dispatch to merge, with each lane's title and
# pull request), quota and the history.tsv samples. A lane the captain holds is parked,
# not stuck.
# Each build also atomically replaces data.json (every metric with its status and source;
# GET/HEAD /data.json serves it as application/json) and writes three self-contained HTML
# pages (inline CSS and SVG, no script, no network reference), phone first:
#   index    Overview: Main's ask list, attention chips, six tiles and trends, lane waits,
#            14-day in/out chart, homes, quota runway, devices and machine
#   backlog  queued, ready and held work per home, held-for-captain items, every lane, agents
#   measure  every number's one definition (what it counts, source, window and cutoff, how
#            often it is read), records that disagree, sources not read
# Method owns the metric definitions shared with data.json's coverage and source metadata.
# Backlog lists default to action grouping, with a by-home variant.
# Parked homes are left out of every total, with one line saying so.
# Sources are local records, existing caches and read-only probes; no GitHub or SSH collection runs during builds.
# Remote lane/backlog records are unavailable, not read from same-named local paths.
#   data/captain-asks.tsv           Waiting on you: Main's fleet-wide headerless
#                                   id<TAB>since-epoch<TAB>text<TAB>url; each row with an id and
#                                   text is an ask (a bad time or duplicate id shows as a record
#                                   needing correction); blank rows and rows without an id or text
#                                   are skipped, with a note; absent/empty means zero

# history.tsv (lane, stuck and ready counts sampled every 10 minutes, kept 8 days).
# .cache.lock serializes cache updates across builds.
#
# Usage:
#   fm-dashboard.sh [build]
#   fm-dashboard.sh serve [--bind ADDR] [--port N]
# build (the default) writes $FM_HOME/state/dashboard/ and prints the index page path.
# serve runs a small read-only web server (python3 stdlib, IPv4) that answers GET or
# HEAD for / (the app, its files under bin/fm-dashboard/ and /board.json), /overview (the
# index page), /backlog, /measure and /data.json; every other path is 404. The app's
# files and both JSON files carry an ETag, answer 304 while unchanged and are gzipped
# for a client that accepts it (the font is not); the app's CSP allows its own origin
# only. ?group=home or ?group=action picks how lists are grouped and is remembered in
# a cookie. It answers at once with the last built pages, marked "updated N s ago",
# retaining source timestamps from the build, and keeps them fresh itself: a side
# thread starts each rebuild early enough, by the last build's length,
# for the new pages to land as the old ones turn 60 seconds old, and the pages reload
# themselves every 60 seconds; only the very first load waits for a build. Requests are
# answered on their own threads, so an idle connection never holds another one up.
# It prints `serving http://ADDR:PORT/` once listening. ADDR defaults to
# 127.0.0.1 and PORT to 8787; port 0 picks a free port. There is no authentication:
# reach is whatever the bind address exposes.
