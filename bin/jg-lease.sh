# jg-lease.sh - claim, release, inspect, and sweep per-task supervision leases.
#
# The lease contract itself (file format, actors, staleness, guard semantics)
# is owned by bin/jg-lease-lib.sh; this is the command surface the two
# supervision actors use around the overlap set (steering, stopping, cleanup,
# backlog status, stuck-worker recovery). "backlog" is the reserved resource
# the branch prompt claims around its own backlog writes; main's tasks-axi path
# is deliberately unguarded in this scope.
#
# Usage:
#   jg-lease.sh claim <task> [--actor main|branch]
#       Take the lease for the calling actor. Idempotent for the holder (the
#       claim refreshes its own lease). Refuses with exit 6 while the other
#       actor holds a live lease. A stale lease (dead pid, or a torn record)
#       is cleared and re-claimed.
#   jg-lease.sh release <task> [--actor main|branch]
#       Drop the calling actor's lease. Releasing a lease the actor does not
#       hold is a silent no-op, so a retry after a partial failure is safe.
#       Naming the other actor is refused loudly.
#   jg-lease.sh check <task>
#       Print "<actor> <pid> <epoch> <live|stale>" for a held lease, or
#       nothing (exit 1) when the task is unleased.
#   jg-lease.sh release-actor --actor main|branch
#       Drop every lease the named actor holds; the Pi branch extension runs
#       this at generation activation so a replaced branch conversation's
#       leases never outlive it.
#   jg-lease.sh sweep
#       Remove every provably stale lease in this home, then clear this home's
#       abandoned lease-command lock scratch (owner directories of dead holders,
#       and a steal mutex no live section can still own), printing each path it
#       removed. Run at session start (a lease held by a dead actor is cleared at
#       session start); safe to run any time - a live lease and a live lock
#       holder are never touched.
#
# The default actor is $JG_SUPERVISION_ACTOR (else main); when --actor is
# supplied for a mutation, it must name that calling actor. Exit codes: 0 ok,
# 1 check-miss, 2 usage, 6 refused (other actor holds or actor mismatch).
# jg-compat (shim, slice S1; deleted by S10): old names still resolve.
